I know you think you deserve an explanation on the meaning of life
But what you think that you heard slipped away at the back of your mind

You get your mucky fingers burnt
You get your truth or your lies you have learnt
And all your plastic believers they leave us and they won't return

Walk on

And when you look in the mirror and your tying all your buttons and bows
And as you face your disease you can squeeze into the emperor's clothes

You found your gun in a paperbag
You get your history from the union jack
And all your brothers and sisters have gone and they wont come back

Failed the life in the city
All the fonies that roam at night
When I've gone yeah you look like you missed me
So come along with me, don't ask why

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
