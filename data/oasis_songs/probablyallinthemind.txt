Show me who you are 
I'll show you what you love 
I'll give you half the world if that's enough 

Let me take you down 
Let me hear you smile 
Let me rest my head here for a while 

In the end we'll leave it all behind 
Because the life I think I'm trying to find 
Is probably all in the mind 

Show me who you are 
I'll show you what you love 
I'll give you all the world if that's enough
