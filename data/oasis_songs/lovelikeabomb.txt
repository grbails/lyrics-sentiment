I'm seeing
A whole other world in my mind
Girl I feel it
I'm breathing a love all the time

You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind

You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind

Am I reaching
The World that I want deep inside
Girl I mean it
Here hold the key to the shrine

You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind

You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind

(blowing my minddddd!!!!)

Nah nah nah

Yeah i'm seeing
A whole other world in my mind
Girl I feel it
I'm breathing a love all the time

You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind

You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind

Yeah I'm seeing!
