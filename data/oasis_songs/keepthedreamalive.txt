Four Seasons.. seconds flick and flash... I'm alone
A lonely scream provides the scene
It's no home
Every night I hear you scream,
But you don't say what you mean
This was my dream, but now my dream has flown

I'm at the crossroads waiting for a sign
My life is standing still, but I'm still alive
Every night I think I know
In the morning where did he go
The answers disappear when I open my eyes

I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams collide
And even though I fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
