We put this festival on you bastards, with a lot of love
We worked around the year for you pigs
Are you gonna break our walls down?
Are you gonna try it?
Well you go to hell!

Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes

Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes

I love it, good rhythm over here
Yes all are welcome
Yes indeed, I love them
Fun, nice, life, youths, beautiful
I'm all for it!
