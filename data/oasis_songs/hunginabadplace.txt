I can go where I wanna 
Be who I wanna be now 
I can sleep under water 
Never worried what I'm gonna dream now 

Yeah the times come and gone 
And I know where I'm from 
And can be so...
It's hasta manana 
You're on your own banana skin feet now 

Yeah I've been hung in a bad place 
Had no sun over my face 
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place 
For too long 

I can say what I wanna 
Feel how I wanna feel now 
I can squeeze all the hours 
I choose to devour with ease now 

I can sing to the trees 
Tarzan on harmonies for free yeah 
You've been blocked and you're stalling 
Nature is calling for me (you got me!)

Yeah I've been hung in a bad place 
Had no sun over my face 
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place 
For too long
