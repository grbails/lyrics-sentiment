I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty
And I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

And when I leave this island
I'll book myself into a soul asylum
'Cause I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

So here I go
Still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old

So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found
But I don't feel down

And when I leave this planet,
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it
And I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

And if I could leave this spirit,
I'll find me a hole and I'll live in it
And I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

Here I go,
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old

So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found
But I don't feel down
No, I don't feel down
No, I don't feel down

I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
