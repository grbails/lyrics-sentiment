Born on a different cloud 
from the ones that have burst round town 
It's no surprise to me 
that yer classless, clever and free...

Loaded just like the gun 
You're the hero that's still unsung 
Living on borrowed time 
You're my sun and you're gonna shine 

Talking to myself again 
This time I think I'm getting through 
It's funny how you think 
It's funny when you do 

Lonely soul 
Busy working overtime 
Nothing ever gets done 
Specially when your hands are tied 

Lonely soul 
Baking up your mother's pride 
Nothing ever gets done 
Not until your war's won
