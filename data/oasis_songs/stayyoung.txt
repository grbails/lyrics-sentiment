One way out is all you're ever gonna get
From those who'll hand it out don't never let it upset you
Cos they'll put words into our mouths they're making us feel so ashamed 

Making us take the blame
Making us cold in the night
Making us question my heart and soul
And I think that it's not quite right 

Hey! stay young and invincible
Cos we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
Cos we know just what we are 

Feed your head with all the things you need
When you're hungry
Stay in bed and sleep all day as long as it's Sunday
Cos they'll put words into your mouth they're making you feel so ashamed
