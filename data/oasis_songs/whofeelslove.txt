Found what I'd lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside 

Thank you for the sun the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies & fears
I feel love 

I'm leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breath 

Now you understand that this is not the promised land
They spoke of
There's nothing more to be
If you can be the remedy who heals love
