All your dreams are made
When you're chained to (your) mirror with (your) razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
(I'm) walking to the sound of your favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon 

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well 

What's the story morning glory?
Well
(you) need a little time to wake up
Wake up well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up
Wake up 

(Cos) all your dreams are made
Now you're chained to the mirror with your razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
(It's) another sunny afternoon
Yeah I'm walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow doesn't know what it doesn't know too soon 

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess that you might as well 

What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well 

Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
