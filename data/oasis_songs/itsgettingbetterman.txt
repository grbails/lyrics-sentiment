Say Something shout it from the roof tops off your head
Make it sort of mean something make me understand or I'll forget
The people here on life's beaches they wish upon the waves that hide the sand
Let them know that life teaches you to build a castle in the hand 

Maybe the songs that we sing are wrong
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone
So bring it on home and it wont be long
It's getting better man! 

Hey! What was that you said to me?
Just say the word and I'd be free?
And where the stars are shining bright
It's getting better man!
And crashing in upon a wave
It's calling out beyond the grave
And We're the fire in the sky
We're getting better man! 

Build something build a better place and call it home
Even if it means nothing you'll never-ever feel that you're alone
