Yeah I feel like the force of nature 
could make you sing like a bird released 
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure 
you know it's buried beneath your feet 
You know you look like faded picture 
I see the cracks freezing on your skin 
and as the world slowly turns and hits you 
that the thieves of the night 
are coming to take you in 

For smoking all my stash 
and burning all my cash 
I bet you knew right away 
it's all over town that 
the sun's going down 
on the days of your easy life. 

I bet you knew right away 
you dope you don't know where it's at 
It's all over town 
that the sun's gone down 
and it's high time to pray.

then get on your knees and pray.
