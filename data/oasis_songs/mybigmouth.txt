Everybody knows ... but no-one's saying nothing
And it's a sound so very loud ... that no-one can hear
I got something in my shoe ... it's keeping me from walking
Down the long and winding road ... back home to you 

Around this town you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's gonna take the blame for ... 

My big mouth, my big name
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking
Slowly down the hall of fame?
Into my big mouth you could fly a plane
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking
Slowly down the hall of fame?
Slowly down the hall of fame 

I ain't never spoke to God
And I ain't never been to heaven
But you assumed I knew the way
Even though the map was given
And as you look into the eyes
Of a bloody cold assassin
Only then you'll realise
With who's life you have been messin'
