It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me
To go through all the things that I want to be
I don't believe in everything I see
Y'know I'm blind so why d'you disagree 

So take me away cos I just dont want to stay
Cos all the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days but they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by 

All Around The World, you've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You're gonna make a better day
All Around The World, you've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You know it's gonna be okay 

So what you gonna do when the walls come falling down?
You never move you never make a sound
So where you gonna swim with the ridges that you found?
If you're lost at sea then I hope that you've drowned
