Listen up
What's the time said today
I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up
To the top of the world
I wanna see my crime 

Day by day
There's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts
That you think and the words
They won't let you say 

One fine day
Gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad
If I had more time 

Sailing down a river alone
I've been trying to find
My way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic But I don't mind being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own 

[Repeat from top]

Sailing down a river alone
I've been trying to find
My way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind
Being on my own
No, I don't mind being on my own
I said I don't mind being on my own
