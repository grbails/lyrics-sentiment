Calling on the stars to fall
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Come for me and set me free
Lift me up and take me where I stand

She believes in everything
and everyone and you and yours and mine
I waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me out my mind

Hey Lyla
The star's about to fall -
So what you say Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so small Lyla
If you can hear me call then I can say Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I fall

She's the queen of all I've seen
And every song and city far and near
Heaven help me mademoiselle
She rings the bell for all the world to hear
