I gotta show you, man,
The meaning of soul
I'm taking on love tonight

Get outta my way, yeah, man,
I dig what you say
But that ain't enough, alright

I'm a different breed
I'm outta your league
I'm ten out of ten, all night
Get outta my way
I'm about to do what you say
And that ain't enough alright

Alright I see the love in your eyes
If it's alright
All night
Then I'll be your light

I gotta show you the meaning of soul
Now we'll take it all up tonight
Get outta my way
I wanna do what you say
And that ain't enough alright

I'm a different breed
I'm outta your league
I'm ten out of ten, all night
Get outta my way
I'm about to do what you say
And that ain't enough alright

All right I see the love in your eyes
And its all right, can I be your light

I gotta show you about the meaning of soul
Take it on up tonight
