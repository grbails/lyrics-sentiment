A little space
A little time
See what it can do

A little faith
Peace of mind
See what passes through

The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head
And all will be brand new

Come alive
Come on in
Something let you know

The worlds as wide
As your life is thin
So entertain your goals

The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head
And all will be brand new
All will be brand new

I can tell you what you wanna hear
I've been there once before
You brought me through the empty nights
Sleepless on your floor

The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head
And all will be brand new
All will be brand new
