They got nothing on me anymore, they got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore, all I want is the truth

I don't feel
to unveil,
in my soul,
singled out

They got nothing on me anymore, they got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore, all I want is the truth

I don't feel
to unveil,
hear my sound,
singled out
watch my style,
pick a place,
what a smile
from your face

I don't feel
to unveil,
in my soul,
singled out
watch my style,
pick a place,
what a smile
from your face

Hey-e- Yeah-e-ey!

They got nothing on me anymore, they got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore, all I want is the truth
