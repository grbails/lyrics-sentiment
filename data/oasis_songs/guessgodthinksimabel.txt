I could be your lover
You could be you mind
We go on forever
Till the end of time

You could be my best friend
Stay up all night long
You could be my railroad
We'd go on and on

Lets get along
There's nothing here to do
Lets go find a rainbow
I could be wrong but what am i to do

Guess god thinks I'm Abel

You could be my enemy
I guess there's still time
I get round to loving you
Is that such a crime?

Lets get along
There's nothing here to do
Lets go find a rainbow
I could be wrong but what am i to do

Guess god thinks I'm Abel

No one can break us
No one could take us
If they tried

No one can break us
No one could take us
If they tried

Come on over
Let's make it tonight
