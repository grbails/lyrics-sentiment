Underneath the sky of red
Is a storyteller sleeping alone
He has no face and he has no name
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown 

All he needs is his life ln a suitcase
It belongs to a friend of a friend
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again 

So wish me away to an unknown place
Am I living in a land with no name
I'll be making a start with a brand new heart
Stop me making sense again 

All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend's
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
