I know a girl who's lost and lonely
Sits by the phone on her own
But the phone don't ring
And the birds don't sing in her tree
She lost herself in a haze of pity
And doesn't know where to run
Needs a headshrinker now
And I think its time we had some fun 

Lost in a fog
Up a tree like a dog
And I'm out of here
I got no name
And I feel no shame
And I got no fear
And I bow down
To the tears of a clown
Whatever's going down
Is coming around
I hope you don't regret today
For the rest of your lives 

For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
