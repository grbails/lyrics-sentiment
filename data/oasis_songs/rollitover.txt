I can give a hundred million reasons
To build a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed 

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right 

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here 

Look around at all the plastic people
Who live without a care
Try to sit with me around my table
But never bring a chair 

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right 

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here
