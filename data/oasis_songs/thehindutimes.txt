I get up - when I'm down 
I can't swim - but my soul won't drown 
I do believe - I got flare 
I got speed and I walk on air 

Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)
Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)

And I get so high I just can't feel it 
And I get so high I just can't feel it 

In and out my brain, runnin' through my veins 
Cos you're my sunshine you're my rain 

There's a light - that shines on 
Shines - on - me - and it keeps me warm 
It gimme peace - I must say 
I can't sleep - cos the world won't wait
