Get on the rollercoaster
The fair's in town today
Y'gotta be bad-enough to beat the brave 

So get on the helter skelter
Bowl into the fray
Y'gotta be bad-enough to beat the brave 

You fade in-out
You fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow we'll be castaway 

Coming in-out of nowhere
Singin' rhapsody
Y'gotta be bad-enough to wanna be 

Sitting upside a high chair
With the devils refugee
Is gonna be blinded by the light
That follows me 

She fade in-out
She fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow she'll be castaway
