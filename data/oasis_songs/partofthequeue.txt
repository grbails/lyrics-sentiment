Suddenly I found that I lost my way in the city
Streets in the thousands all the colours bleed into one
Fall down heaven wont help me
Call out no one would hear
All of a sudden I lost my outta the city

Stand tall
Stand proud
Every beginning is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town

The names and the faces in the places they mean nothing to me
Cos all they can do to be part of the queue in this town
Fall down heaven wont help me
Call out no one will hear
People tomorrow they say "well I say what a pity"

Stand tall
Stand proud
Every beginning is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town

Stand tall
Stand proud
Every beginning is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town

Finding my soul in this town
Keep on trying
