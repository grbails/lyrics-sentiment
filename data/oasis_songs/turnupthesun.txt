I carry madness
Everywhere I go
Over a border
And back to the snow

So if you see me
And I look right through
You shouldn't take it
As a reflection of you

Come on, Turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another

The boys in the bubble
They wanna be free
And they got so blind
That they cannot see

But I'm not your keeper
I don't have the key
I got a piano
I can't find the C

Come on, Turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another
