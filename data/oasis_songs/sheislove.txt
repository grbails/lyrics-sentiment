Oh when the sunshine beckons to ya 
And your wings begin to unfold 
the thoughts you bring and the songs you sing 
are gonna keep me from the cold 

And if the sword is among ya 
and its words may wound my soul 
you can fill me up with what you've got 
cos my heart's been keeping old 

[CHORUS]
She is love 
and her ways are high and steep 
She is love 
and I believe her when she speaks. 
Love 
and her ways are high and steep 
She is love 
and I believe, I do believe her when she speaks.

You're in all my thoughts of passion 
And the dreams of my delight 
Whatever stirs my mortal frame 
will you keep it warm at night 

I don't know where you come from 
no I haven't got a clue 
All I know is I'm in love 
with someone who loves me too.
