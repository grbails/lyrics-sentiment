Hold the line
Friend of mine
Sing a song
Soldier on

Shine a light
For me tonight
Don't be long
Soldier on

La la la
La la la
La la la
La la la

Who's to say
That you were right
And I was wrong
Soldier on

Come the day
Come the night
I'll be gone
Soldier on

La la la
La la la
La la la
La la la

Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on
