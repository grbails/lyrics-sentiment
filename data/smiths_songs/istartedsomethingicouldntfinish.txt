The lanes were silent
With nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced
Three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
That's what Tradition means
And I doused another venture
With a gesture
That was...absolutely vile
I started something
Forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
That's what Tradition means
And now eighteen months' hard-labour
Seems..fair enough
I started something
Forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
And now I'm not too sure
