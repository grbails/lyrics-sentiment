In a river the colour of lead
immerse a baby's head
wrap her up in the News Of The World
dump her on a doorstep, girl
this night has opened my eyes
and I will never sleep again

You kicked and cried like a bullied child
a grown man of twenty-five
he said he'd cure your ills
but he didn't and he never will
so, save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
reminds you of your own again
she took away your troubles
oh but then again she left pain
so please save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad
