Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry

Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die

Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind

Gasping - but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am

Gasping - dying - but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am

Please keep me in mind
