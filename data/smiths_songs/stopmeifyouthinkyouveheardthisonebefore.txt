Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar

And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said lied I'd to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied?
Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied?
Because I never

I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen and broke my knee
And then he really lays into me
Friday night in out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied?
Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied?
Because I never

And so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor
I drank more

Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love
