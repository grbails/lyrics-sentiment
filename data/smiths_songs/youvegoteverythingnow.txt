As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen
in the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost?
well, this is true
and yet, it's false
but did I ever tell you, by the way
I never did like your face

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
