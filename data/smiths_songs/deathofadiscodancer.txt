The death of a disco dancer
Well, it happens a lot 'round here
And if you think Peace
Is a common goal
Well, that goes to show
Just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
Well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
...but maybe in the next world
