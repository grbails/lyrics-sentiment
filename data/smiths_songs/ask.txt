Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to

Shyness is nice and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to

So if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME I WON'T SAY "NO", HOW COULD I?

Coyness is nice and
Coyness can stop you
From saying all the things in
Life you'd like to

So if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME I WON'T SAY "NO", HOW COULD I?

Spending warm Summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg

ASK ME ASK ME ASK ME
ASK ME ASK ME ASK ME

Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb
That will bring us together

Nature is a language, can't you read?
Nature is a language, can't you read?

SO ASK ME ASK ME ASK ME
ASK ME ASK ME ASK ME

Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb
That will bring us together

If it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

SO ASK ME ASK ME ASK ME
ASK ME ASK ME ASK ME
Oh, la...
