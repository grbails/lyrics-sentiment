I won't share you
I won't share you
With the drive
The ambition
And the zeal I feel
This is my time
As the note I wrote
Was read, she said
Has the Perrier gone
Straight to my head
Or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No - no - no - no - no - no
I won't share you
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time
Life tends to come and go
Well, that's OK
Just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
Well, that's OK
Just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time
This is my time
