I would rather not go
back to the old house
I would rather not go
back to the old house
there's too many
bad memories
too many memories

When you cycled by
here began all my dreams
the saddest thing I've ever seen
and you never knew
how much I really liked you
because I never even told you
oh, but I meant to

Are you still there?
or have you moved away?
or have you moved away?

I would love to go
back to the old house
but I never will
I never will
I never will
I never will
