Everyday you must say
so how do I feel about my life
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?

I am sick and I am dull
and I am plain
how dearly I'd love to get carried away
oh but dreams have a knack of just not coming true
and time is against me now

Who and what to blame?
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?
for heaven's sake
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
everyday you must say
how do I feel about the past

Others conquered love - but I ran
I sat in my room and I drew up a plan
but plans can fall through as so often they do
and time is against me now

And there's no one left to blame
tell me when will you
when will you accept your life
the one that you hate
for anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
everyday you must say
how do I feel about my shoes

They make me awkward and plain
how dearly I would love to kick with the fray
but I once had a dream and it never came true
and time is against me now
time is against me now

And there's no one but yourself to blame
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
anything is hard to find
for heaven's sake
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?
when?
