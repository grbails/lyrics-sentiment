Ooh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Because there's somebody here
Who really really loves you
Stay home
Be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Because there's somebody here
Who'll take a hatchet to your ear
How the frustration renders me
Hateful, Glenn!
Don't come to the house tonight
Don't come to the house tonight
Because you'll slip on the
Trail of my bespattered remains
And so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE
