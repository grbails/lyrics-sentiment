On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face

A double-bed
And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor

A double-bed
And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor

A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on Prisoner's Aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
It's written all over my face

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the railway-station
It's written all over my face
