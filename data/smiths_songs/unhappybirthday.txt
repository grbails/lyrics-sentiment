I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
but I won't cry

Loved and lost
And some may say
When usually it's nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
And "May the lines sag heavy
And deep tonight"

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
But I won't cry

Loved and lost
Some people say
When usually its Nothing
Surly you're happy
It should be this way?
I said "No"
And then I shot myself
So, drink, drink, drink
And be ill tonight

From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
