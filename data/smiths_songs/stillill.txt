I decree today that life is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why and I'll spit in your eye

But we cannot cling
to the old dreams anymore
no we cannot cling
to those dreams

Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like
the old days anymore
no it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
am I still ill?

Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

Ask me why and I'll die
oh ask me why and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often

Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like
the old days anymore
no it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
am I still ill?
