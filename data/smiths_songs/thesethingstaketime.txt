My eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wonderkind
you took me behind a disused railway line
and said "I know a place where we can go
where we are not known"
and you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
and the hills are alive with celibate cries
but you know where you came from
you know where you're going
and you know where you belong
you said I was ill, and you were not wrong

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

Oh the alcoholic afternoons
when we sat in your room
they meant more to me than any
than any living thing on earth
they had more worth
than any living thing on earth

Vivid and in your prime
you will leave me behind
you will leave me behind
