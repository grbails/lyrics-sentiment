He's got too much money and 
He's got too many girlfriends 
I'm jealous, that's all 

Have you seen him go, though, oh?

He's got too many girlfriends 
He thinks he owns this city 
He over speeds and he never gets pulled over 

Have you seen him go, though, oh? 
Have you seen him go, though, oh?

He thinks he got the whole world in his hands 
And I'm gonna ... kill him !
Oh, no!
