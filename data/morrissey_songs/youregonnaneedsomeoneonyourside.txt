With the world's fate resting on your shoulders,
You're gonna need someone on your side.
You can't do it by yourself any longer,
You're gonna need someone on your side.

Someone kindly told me that you'd wasted
Eight of nine lives.
Oh, give yourself a break before you break down.
You're gonna need someone on your side.

And here I am!
And here I am!
Well, you don't need to look so pleased.

Day or night, there is no difference,
You're gonna need someone on your side.
Day or night, there is no difference,
You're gonna need someone soon.

And here I am!
And here I am!
Well, you don't need to look so pleased
