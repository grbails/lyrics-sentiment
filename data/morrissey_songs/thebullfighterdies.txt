Mad in Madrid
Ill in Seville 
Lonely in Barcelona 
Then someone told you and you cheer

Hooray, hooray 
The bullfighter dies 
Hooray, hooray 
The bullfighter dies 
And nobody cries 
Nobody cries 
Because we all want the bull to survive

Gaga in MÃ¡laga
No mercy in Murcia 
Mental in Valencia 
Then someone tells you and you cheer

Hooray, hooray 
The bullfighter dies 
Hooray, hooray 
The bullfighter dies 
And nobody cries 
Nobody cries 
Because we all want the bull to survive
