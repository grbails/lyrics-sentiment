These tears I'm wailing
I spill not without reason
Remove them my dearest love my

Take me, to the place I've been dreaming of
Where the grotesquely lonely meet the grotesquely lonely
And they whisper
Just very softly
Please be mine Dearest Love
Be my dearest love
Be my dearest love

I have hung on , hung on, hung on for one hundred years
For someone to shake me someone to wake me
If necessary someone to break me
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love
