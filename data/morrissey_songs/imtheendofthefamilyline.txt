With no complications
fifteen generations
of mine
all honouring Nature
until I arrive
with incredible style

I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
out into this seething whirl
by chance or whim
or even love?
our family tree hacked into decline
and I'm spared the pain
of ever saying 
goodbye

I'm the end of the line
the end of the family line
the end of the line
