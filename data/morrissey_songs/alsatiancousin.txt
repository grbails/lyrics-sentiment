Were you and he lovers?
and would you say so if you were?
on a forecourt
on a Friday
passing my way
Were you and he lovers?
and if you were, then say that you were!
on a groundsheet
under canvas
with your tent-flap
open wide
A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
Oh!
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply
"but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask even though I know
were you and he lovers?
