The more you ignore me
the closer I get
you're wasting your time
the more you ignore me
the closer I get
you're wasting your time
I will be
in the bar
with my head
on the bar
I am now
a central part
of your mind's landscape
whether you care
or do not
yeah, I've made up your mind
the more you ignore me
the closer I get
you're wasting your time
the more you ignore me
the closer I get
you're wasting your time
Beware!
I bear more grudges
than lonely high court judges
when you sleep
I will creep
into your thoughts 
like a bad debt
that you can't pay
take the easy way
and give in
yeah, and let me in
IT'S WAR
