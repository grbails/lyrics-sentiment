Further into the fog I fall
well, I was just
following you!
when you said:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial a cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial a cliche)
But the person underneath
where does he go?
does he slide by the wayside?
or...does he just die?
when you find that you've organized 
your feelings, for people
who didn't like you then 
and certainly don't like you now
yet still you say:
"Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
(dial a cliche)
"grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
(dial a cliche)
"the Safe way is the only way!
there's always time to change, son!"
yes well I've changed
but I'm in pain!
