Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all

Day after day you say "one day, one day"
Day after day you say "one day, one day"
But you're in the wrong place
and you've got the wrong face
And humans are not really very humane
And earth is the loneliest planet of all

Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Live with a lowness that no one else knows
Time after time you say "next time, next time"
Time after time you say "next time, next time"
But you fail as a woman
and you lose as a man
We do what we can
And earth is the cruelest place
you will never understand

But you're in the wrong skin
And the skin that you're in
Says "oh, let it begin"
And earth is the loneliest planet of all

Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all

Day after day you say "one day, one day"
Day after day you say "one day, one day"
And there's always a reason why you're refused
They always blame "you, you, you"
And there is nothing anyone can do
