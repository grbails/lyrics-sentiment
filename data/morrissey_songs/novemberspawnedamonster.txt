Sleep on and dream of Love
because it's the closest you will get to love
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me from
pity, sympathy and people discussing me"
a frame of useless limbs what can make GOOD
all the BAD that's been done?
And if the lights were out
could you even bear
to kiss her full on the mouth or anywhere?
poor twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
poor twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me
one November spawned a monster 
in the shape of this child who must remain
a hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
a hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
a symbol of where mad, mad lovers
must PAUSE and draw the line
So sleep and dream of love
because it's the closest
you will get to love
that November is a time which I must put OUT of my mind
oh one fine day 
LET IT BE SOON
she won't be rich or beautiful
but she'll be walking your streets
in the clothes that she went out
and chose for herself
