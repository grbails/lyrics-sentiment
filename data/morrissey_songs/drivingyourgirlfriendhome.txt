I'm driving 
your girlfriend home
and she's saying
how she never chose you
"turn left", she says
so I turn left
and she says
"So how did I end up
so deeply involved in
the very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
and I can't answer
I'm driving
your girlfriend home
and she's laughing
to stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
so I drive on
and she says
"So how did I end up
attached to this person
when his sense of humour
gets gradually worser?"
and I can't tell her
I'm parking 
outside her home
and we're shaking hands
goodnight, so politely
