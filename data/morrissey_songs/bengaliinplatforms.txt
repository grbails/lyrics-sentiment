No no no
he does not want to depress you
oh no no no no no
he only wants to impress you
Bengali in platform
she only wants to embrace your culture
and to be your friend forever
Bengali, Bengali
oh shelve your Western plans
and understand that life is hard enough when you belong here
A silver-studded rim that glistens
and an ankle-star that blinds me
a lemon sole so very high
which only reminds me, to tell you
so I break the news gently
I break the news to you gently
Shelve your plans
Bengali, Bengali
its the touchy march of time
that blinds you
don't blame me
don't hate me
just because I'm the one to tell you
that life is hard enough when you belong here
life is hard enough when you belong here
shelve your western plans
life is hard enough when you belong here
