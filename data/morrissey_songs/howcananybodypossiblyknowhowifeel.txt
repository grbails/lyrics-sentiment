She told me she loved me
Which means
She must be insane
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not, And I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
The only one around here who is me
Is me

They said they respect me
Which means
Their judgement is crazy
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not And I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
When they are they
And only I am I

He said he wants to befriend me
Which means
He can't possibly know me
The voices of the real
And the imagined cry:
"The future is passing you by
The future is passing you by"

So how can anybody possibly think they know how I feel?
Everybody look, see pain and walk away
And as for you in your uniform
Your smelly uniform
You think you can be rude to me
Because you wear a uniform
A smelly uniform
And so you think you can be rude to me

But even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, sick and depraved, a traveller to the grave
I would never be you
I would never be you
