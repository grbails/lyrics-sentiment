All over this town 
Yes, a low wind may blow 
And I can see through everybodyâ€™s clothes 
With no reason 
To hide these words I feel 
And no reason 
To talk about the books I read 
But still I do 
That's 'cause I'm a ... Sister I'm a
All over this town 
Along this way 
Outside the prison gates 
I love the romance of crime 
And I wonder 
Does anybody feel the way I do? 
And is evil just something you are 
Or something you do? 
Sister I'm a ... Sister I'm a
All over this town, All over this town 
They pull over 
In their Citroen vans 
Not to shake your hand 
With meths on their breaths 
And you with youth on your side 
A plastic bag stranded at the lights 
This once was me
But now I'm a ... Sister I'm a
All over this town ... Oh, oh, oh 
All over this town, All over this town, Oh
I still cannot speak French, I am very lazy
