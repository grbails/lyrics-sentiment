Don Juan
Picaresque 
Wife beater vest 
Cold hand 
Ice man 
Warring cave man 
Well if this is what it takes to describe... 
I'm not a man

Wheeler, dealer 
Mover, shaker 
Casanova 
Beefaroni 
A-ho but lonely 
Well if this is what it takes to describe... 
I'm not a man 
I'm not a man 
I'm something much bigger and better than 
A man

Wise-ass 
Smart-ass 
Workaholic 
Thick-skinned 
Two-fisted hombre, ol√© 
Well if these are terms you'd use to describe...

Oh, I'm shaking 
Look at me I'm quaking 
True grit 
True blue 
Kill crazy 
So very manly of you 
You are the soldier 
Who won't get much older 
You are the slow Joe 
Who signed up to go

Wolf down 
Wolf down 
T-bone steak 
Wolf down 
Cancer of the prostate

Ways to sit 
And of course 
Ways to stand 
I'm not a man 
I'm not a man 
No big fat locker room 
Hockey jock 
Laughing 
I'm not a man 
I'd never kill or eat an animal 
And I never would destroy this planet I'm on 
Well, what do you think I am? 
A man?
