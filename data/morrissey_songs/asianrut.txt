Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
oh Asian boy
what are you on?
Day oh so late
strangely the sun still shone
what drugs are you on?
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to avenge
the cruel, cold killing
of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
has come here to take revenge
for the cruel, cold killing
of his only friend
Peace through the school
so quiet in the hall
it's a strange sign for one
of what's to come
Tough and hard and pale
oh they may just impale you on railings
oh English boys
it must be wrong
three against one?
Brakes slammed, and
a gun jammed, and
as far as I could tell
brave Asian boy
dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
on my way to somewhere civilised
and maybe I'll even arrive
maybe I'll even arrive?
