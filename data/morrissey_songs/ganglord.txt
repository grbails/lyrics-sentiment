Ganglord, the police are
Kicking there way into my house
And haunting me
Taunting me!
Wanting me to break their laws.

Ganglord, the police are
Kicking there way into my house
And hauting me!
Taunting me!
Wanting me to break their laws.

And I'm turning to you
To save me,
And I'm turning to you
To save me

Ganglord, the police are
Grinding me into the ground.
The headless pack are back
Small boy jokes and loaded guns

And I'm turning to you
To save me,
And I'm turning to you
To save me! Save me! Save me! Save me

Gandlord, there's a clock on the wall
Making fun of us all

Ganglord, the clock on the wall
Makes a joke of us all

And I'm turning to you to save me
And I'm turning to you
To save me! Save me! Save me! Save me

Ganglord, remember
The police can always be bribed

They say to protect and to serve
But what they really mean to say is
Get back to the ghetto! The ghetto, the ghetto
Get yourself back to the ghetto!
The ghetto! The ghetto!
Get yourself back to the ghetto!
The ghetto! The ghetto!
