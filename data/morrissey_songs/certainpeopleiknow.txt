I take the cue from 
Certain people I know 
I use the cue And then I 
Hand it on to you 
And when I swing it 
So, it catches his eye
Weren't you there? 
You'd have died!
I trust the views of 
Certain people I know 
They look at Danger 
And they 
LAUGH THEIR HEADS OFF 
Their clothes are Imitation 
George the 23rd 
Don't you find this absurd?
I'd hate to be like 
Certain people I know 
They break their necks 
And can't afford to
Get them fixed 
Ah, they'd sacrifice all 
Of their principles for 
anything cashable 
I do believe it's terrible 
Oh, wo, wo Ah, ah, ah, ah Oh, wo, wo
