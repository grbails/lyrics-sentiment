The joy brings many things

It cannot bring you joy 
Sons of mothers huddle here 
Men and boys

1850 swung the doors 
And human sewage swept inside 
Where victims speak in whines 
And where the hardened cried

I was sent here by a 3 foot half-wit in a wig 
I took his insults on the chin, and never did I flinch

A swagger hides the fear in here 
By this rule we breathe 
And there is no one on this earth 
Who I’d feel sad to leave

You see we all lose 
We all lose

What those in power do to you 
Reminds us at a glance 
How humans hate each others guts 
And show it given a chance

We never say aloud the things 
That we say in our prayers 
Cause no one cares

Many executed here 
By the awful lawfully good 
But the only thing that makes me cry 
Is when I see the sky

Brendan Behan's laughter rings 
For what he had or hadn’t done 
For he knew then as I know now 
That for each and every one of us 
We all lose 
Rich or poor, we all lose 
Rich or poor, they all lose
