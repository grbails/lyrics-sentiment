Angel, Angel
don't take your life tonight
I know they take
and that they take in turn
and they give you nothing real
for yourself in return
and when they've used you
and they've broken you
and wasted all your money
and cast your shell aside
and when they've bought you
and they've sold you
and they've billed you for the pleasure
and they've made your parents cry
I will be here
BELIEVE ME
I will be here
Believe me
Angel, don't take your life
some people have got no pride
they do not understand
the Urgency of life
but I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
