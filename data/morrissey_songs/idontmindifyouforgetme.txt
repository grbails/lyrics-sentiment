I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
so now you send me your hardened 'regards'
when once you'd send me 'love'
sincerely I must tell you
your mild 'best wishes'
they make me suspicious
but I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
having learned my lesson
I never left
an impression on anyone
the pressure to change, to move on
was strange
and very strong
so this is why I tell you
I really do understand
BYE BYE
I don't mind if you forget me
no no no no no no no
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
REJECTION IS ONE THING
BUT REJECTION FROM A FOOL
IS CRUEL
and I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if your forget me
