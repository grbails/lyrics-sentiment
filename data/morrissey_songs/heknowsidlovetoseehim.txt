He Knows, he knows
Or, I think he does
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world...
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy or as close as is allowed
because when I lived
in the Arse of the world
he knows, he knows, he knows I'd love
to see him happy or as close as possible
as close as possible, as close as is allowed
My name still conjures up deadly deeds
and a bad taste in the mouth
the police - they actually knew me
they said
"You're just another person in the world
you're just another fool with radical views
you're just another who has maddening views
you want to turn it on its head
by staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"
