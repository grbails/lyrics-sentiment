Run, run young man through the glen
Run, young woman through the glen
See if I care, see if I care, see if I care
See if I care, See if I care, See if I care

If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways

If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways

Run, run young man through the glen
Run, young woman through the glen
And see if I care, see if I care, see If I care
See if I care, see if I care, see if I care

If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways
If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways
Aways, aways, aways, aways

If you don't want me
You don't have to have me
I just thought you might feel the same, that's all

If you don't want me
You don't have to have me
I just thought you might feel the same, that's all
That's all, that's all, that's all...
