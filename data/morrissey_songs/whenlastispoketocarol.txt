When last I spoke to Carol I said:
"I can't pretend it gets easier."
she said:
"I've hung on, I have edged around this narrow ledge since the day I was born in 1975."
When last I spoke to Carol I said:
"I can't pretend I feel love for you."
she said:
"I've hammered a smile across this pasty face of mine since the day I was born in 1975."
When I said goodbye to Carol
black earth upon the casket fell
she had faded to
something I always knew
to the rescue
nobody ever comes.
