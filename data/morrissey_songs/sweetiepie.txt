Sweetie Pie
I've fallen in love.
And the joke is on me.
And the sun's given up.
I'm depending on you,
To see I get safely to
The port where my heart
Is too lost to find.
And will be there to meet you when it's your time.

Sweetie Pie
I'm ending my life.
Because I've fallen in love.
And enough is enough.
I'm depending on you
To see I get safely to
The port where my heart
Is too lost to find.
And will be there to meet you when it's your time

Sweetie Pie
How I feel in my mind,
And how I live in the world,
They're oceans apart.
I'm depending on you
To see I get safely to
The port where my heart
Is too lost to find.
And will be there to meet you when it's your time.

Oh-ho,
Oh-ho,
Oh-ho,
Oh-ho
