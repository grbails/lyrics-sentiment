Mama, why did you do it?
Mama, who drove you to it?

Was it the pigs in grey suits
Persecuting you?
Uncivil servants
Unconcerned at how they frighten you?

Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you

Mama, why did you do it?
Mama, who drove you to it?

Spare priggish moneymen
Who scared the life out of you
Bailiffs with bad breath
I will slit their throats for you

Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you

Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you

So we're gonna run to you
We're gonna come to you
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama

We're gonna be with you
We're gonna join you
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama

And we'll be safe and sheltered in our graves
We'll come before you
and we will touch you
We'll go for one final hug, mama
