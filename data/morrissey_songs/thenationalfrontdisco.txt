David, the wind blows
The wind blows
Bits of your life away.
Your friends all say,
"Where is our boy?
Ah, we've lost our boy"
But they should know
Where you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
That you're going to
Oh, oh, oh, going to
Yeah, yeah, yeah
"England for the English"
"England for the English"

David, the wind's blown
The wind's blown
All of my dreams away.
And I still say
"Where is our boy?
Ah, we've lost our boy"
But I should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You're going to the National
Ah, to the National

There's a country,
You don't live there
But one day you would like to
And if you show them what you're made of
Ah, then you might do

But David, we wonder
We wonder if the thunder
Is ever really gonna begin
Begin, begin
You're mum says
"I've lost my boy"
But she should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You're going to the National
To the National
To the National Front disco
Because you want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
When you've settled the score

Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
