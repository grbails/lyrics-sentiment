The last night on Maudlin Street
goodbye house
goodbye stairs
I was born here
I was raised here, and
I took some stick here
love at first sight
may sound trite
but it's true, you know
I could list the details
of everything you ever wore
or said, or how you stood that day
and as we spend the last night
on Maudlin Street, I say
Goodbye house-forever!
I never stole a happy hour
around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
became what you see
here I am - the ugliest man
It’s the last night on Maudlin Street
and truly I do love you
oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of 
you framed beside my bed
oh, it's childish and it's silly
but I think it's you in my room
by the bed, yes, I told you it was silly
and I know
I took strange pills
but I never meant to hurt you
oh truly I love you
I came home late one night 
everyone had gone to bed
nobody stays up for you
when you have sixteen stitches
all around your head
the last buss I missed to Maudlin Street
so, he drove me home in the Van
complaining “Women only like me for my mind…”
don't leave your torch behind
power-cuts ahead
as we crept through the park
but no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
off a clothesline for you
but you...without clothes
oh I could not keep a straight face
me - without clothes?
well a nation turns its back and gags...
I'm packed
I am moving house
a half-life disappears today
every slag waves me on
secretly wishing me gone
well, I will be soon
oh - I will be soon
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
when they took you away in a police car
dear Inspector - don't you know?
don't you care?
don't you know - about Love?
Your gran died
and your mother died
on Maudlin Street
in pain and ashamed
with never time to say
those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
well, it's only bricks and mortar!
and...truly I do love you
wherever you are
wherever you are
