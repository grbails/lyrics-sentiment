My life is an
Endless succession
Of people saying goodbye
My life is
An endless succession
Of people saying goodbye
And what's left for me?
What's left for me?
At one time
The future it stretched out before me
But now it stretches behind me.
And all of the best things in life
Are behind glass
Money, jewellery and flesh
And what's left for me?
What's left for me?
