Our unsleepable friend
gets the message on an ill-wind
'all your friends and your foes
would rather die than have to touch you'
TO SAY THE LEAST truly disappointed
truly, truly, truly
Drank too much
said too much
and there's nowhere to go - but Down
young boy - I wanna help you
SEE THESE LINES? Truly disappointed
truly, truly, truly
Don't talk to me now
about people who are nice
'cause I have spent my WHOLE LIFE
in RUINS...
because of people who were nice
This world may lack Style, I know
but each bud must blossom and grow
Young girl one day we really will be old
but the thing is: I love you NOW
This is the last song I will ever sing
No I've changed my mind again
GOODNIGHT
AND THANK YOU
