And when you slam
down the hammer
can you see it in your heart?
All of the rumours
keeping me grounded
I never said that they were
completely unfounded
when you slam
down the hammer
can you see it in your heart?
can you delve so low?
and when you're standing 
on my fingers
can you see it in your heart?
and when you try
to break my spirit
it won't work
because there's nothing left to break
anymore
All of the rumours
keeping me grounded
I never said that they were
completely unfounded
You won't sleep
until the earth that wants me
finally has me
oh you've done it now
You won't rest
until the hearse that becomes me
finally takes me
oh you've done it now
You won't smile
until my loving mouth
is shut good and proper
FOREVER
All of the rumours
keeping me grounded
I never said that they were
completely unfounded
and all those lies
written lies, twisted lies
well, they weren't lies
they weren't lies
they weren't lies
I never said
I could have mentioned your name
I could have dragged you in
guilt by implication
by association
I've always been true to you
in my own strange way
I've always been true to you
in my own sick way
I'll always stay true to you
