Aah, come on to my house 
Come on and do something new 
I know you love one person so 
Why can't you love two? 
Aah, give a little something 
Give a little something 
To My Love Life, to My Love Life 
My Love Life 
I know you love one person so 
Why don't you love two, love? 
Oh, love to
Give a little something 
Give a little something 
To My Love Life, to My Love Life 
My Love Life 
I know you love one person so 
Why don't you love two, love? 
Love to, oh, give a
Love 
I know you love
Aah
