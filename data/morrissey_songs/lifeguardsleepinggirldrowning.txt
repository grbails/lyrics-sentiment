Always looking for attention
always needs to be mentioned
who does she
think she should be?
the shrill cry through darkening air
doesn't she know he's already
had such a busy day?
SOMEBODY TELL HER...SHHH
It was only a test
but she swam too far
against the tide
she deserves all she gets
the sky became mad with stars
as an out-stretched arm slowly
disappears
OH HURRAY
Please don't worry
there'll be no fuss
she was...NOBODY'S NOTHING
When he awoke
the sea was calm
and another day passes like a dream
