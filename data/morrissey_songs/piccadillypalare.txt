Off the rails I was and
off the rails
I was happy to stay
GET OUT OF MY WAY
on the rack I was "easy Meat"
but a reasonably good buy
a reasonably good buy
the Piccadilly palare
was just a silly slang
between me and the boys in my gang
"so bona to vada, OH YOU
your lovely eek and
your lovely riah"
We plied an ancient trade
where we threw all life's
instructions away
exchanging lies and digs (my way)
well, in a belted coat
oh I secretly knew
that I hadn't a clue
the Piccadilly palare
was just a silly slang
between me and the boys in my gang
exchanging palare
you wouldn't understand
good sons like you
NEVER DO
So why do you smile
when you thing about Earls Court?
but you cry when you think of all
the battles you've fought (and lost)?
it may all end tomorrow
or, it could go on forever
(in which case; I'm doomed)
it could go on forever
