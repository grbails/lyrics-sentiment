but the heart has a heart of its own
It's not your birthday anymore
there's no need to be kind to you
and the will to see you smile and belong has now gone

it cannot be given
and so it must be taken
All the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way to the love I am now giving to you right here right now on the floor
