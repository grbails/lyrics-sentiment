Let the heart rest
lay back your head
you were good in your time
and we thank you
You made me feel less alone
you made me feel not quite so
deformed, uninformed and hunchback
Time takes all breath away
you were good in your time
and we thank you so
You said more in one day
than most people say
in a lifetime, it was our time
and we thank you
An end-of-the-ride sigh
your soft smile says:
"please understand, I must surrender."
Then you grip with your hand
now so small in mine
are you aware wherever you are
that you have just died?
