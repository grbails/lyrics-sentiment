There's gonna be some trouble
a whole house will need re-building
and everyone I love in the house
will recline on an analyst's couch quite

just some rain-coated lovers' brothers)
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt
rush to danger
wind up nowhere
Patric Doonan - raised to wait
TIRED again - TRIED again, and
now my heart is full
now my heart is full
and I just can't explain
SO I WON'T EVEN TRY TO
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt
every jammy Stressford poet
loafing oafs in all-night chemists
loafing oafs in all-night chemists
underact - express depression
ah, but Bunnie I loved you
I was tired again
I tried again, and
now my heart is full
now my heart is full
and I just can't explain
SO I WON'T EVEN TRY TO
