First day with the joy you find,
Everyone lies.
First day with the joy you find,
Everyone lies,
Nobody minds,
Everyone lies.
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?

Third week with the joy you find,
Everything dies.
We won't vote Conservative,
Because we never have
Everyone lies, everyone lies,
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?

Everything of worth,
On earth,
Is there to share

I used to dream and I used to vow,
I wouldn't dream of it now.
We look to Los Angeles
For the language we use
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
London is dead
I'm too much in love
I'm too much in love


I know,
I'll go,
Empty hand
From the land
